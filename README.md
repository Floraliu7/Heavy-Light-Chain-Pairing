## Spatial Pairing Algorithm

Our method uses a **spatial pairing algorithm** that maximizes the following objective using a **linear assignment problem**:

To run REPAIR and generate `M`, follow the full guide provided in the official REPAIR repository:

This framework allows us to balance **spatial proximity** and **expression evidence** for robust pairing.

## Data Preparation Guide

To apply this tool to your own dataset, you will need to prepare a single combined **data frame** that includes both spatial and gene expression information.

### Step 1: Create Spatial Barcode Table

Your dataset must include the spatial location of each barcode, with the following columns:

- `barcodes`: spatial barcode (on tissue location ID)
- `imagerow` and `imagecol`: integer pixel positions in the image (used to define spatial coordinates)

This will later be used to create a **point pattern object** for spatial analysis.

**Example:**

| barcodes           | imagerow | imagecol |
|--------------------|----------|----------|
| AAACCTGAGCGTAGTC   | 1193     | 9048     |
| TTCCGACGCTTCACAT   | 1193     | 9223     |
| GCTGTCTGTGATCGAC   | 1192     | 9397     |

---

### Step 2: Prepare Gene Expression Matrix

Your expression matrix should:

- Include **only the barcodes from Step 1** (in the same order)
- Have **columns as clone IDs** (e.g., `heavyclone0`, `heavyclone5`, etc.)
- Have **values** representing expression counts per barcode
- Create **two** expression matrices for both heavy chain and light chain data

**Example:**

| barcodes           | heavyclone0 | heavyclone5 | heavyclone7 |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| AAACCTGAGCGTAGTC   | 0           | 0           | 0           |
| TTCCGACGCTTCACAT   | 0           | 0           | 0           |
| GCTGTCTGTGATCGAC   | 0           | 0           | 1           |

---

### Step 3: Combine into a Data Frame

Merge your spatial coordinates and gene expression matrix **by barcode** into a single data frame. You should create two dataframes for both heavy chain data and light chain data. This combined data will be used to create spatial **point pattern objects** (`ppp`) for each clone.

**Example:**

| barcodes           | imagerow | imagecol | heavyclone0 | heavyclone2 | heavyclone5 | heavyclone7 |
|--------------------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| ATTCAGGATCGCCTCT   | 1193     | 9048     | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |
| GCCCATGGTGCAATG    | 1041     | 9135     | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |
| TTCCGACGCTTCACAT   | 1193     | 9223     | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |
| GCTGTCTGTGATCGAC   | 1192     | 9397     | 0           | 0           | 0           | 1           |
| AAGACTCACGCCCACCT  | 1192     | 9746     | 0           | 0           | 0           | 0           |


Once the dataframe is ready, you can use the provided scripts to:

1. Convert this into spatial point patterns
2. Compute distances between patterns
3. Run the REPAIR model
4. Apply the spatial pairing algorithm

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Convert DataFrame to Spatial Point Patterns

Process **heavy** and **light** chain expression matrices separately to create spatial point patterns for downstream analysis.


#### `clone_info_combined(df, img.scale = 1)`

**Input:**
- `df`: Expression matrix with:
  - Column 1: barcode  
  - Columns 2â€“3: spatial coordinates (`imagerow/imagecol` or `y/x`)  
  - Columns 4+: expression values for each clone  
- `img.scale`: Optional coordinate scaling factor (default = 1)

**Output:**
- A data frame with spatial info for each clone:  
  `x`, `y`, `n`, `clone_id`, `clone_id_rank`


#### `create_ppp_from_clone_info(clone_df)`

**Input:**
- `clone_df`: Output from `clone_info_combined()`

**Output:**
- A `ppp` object (spatial point pattern) with clone metadata as marks

## Solution Output: Chain Pairing Results

After completing the data preparation and running the pairing algorithm, users can generate the **final pairing solution** matrix like the example shown below.

Each row in the output corresponds to a **heavy chain**, and each column corresponds to the **omega value** (the weight between spatial distance and expression similarity):

| heavy_ids | w=0 | w=0.1 | w=0.2 | ... | w=1 |
|-----------|-----|-------|-------|-----|-----|
| 1         | 0   | 0     | 0     | ... | 0   |
| 6         | 2   | 2     | 2     | ... | 2   |
| 8         | 10  | 10    | 10    | ... | 3   |
| ...       | ... | ...   | ...   | ... | ... |

**How to interpret this table:**
- The first column `heavy_ids` lists the IDs of heavy chains.
- Each remaining column (e.g., `w=0`, `w=0.1`, ..., `w=1`) corresponds to a **pairing solution** for a given value of Ï‰ (omega), the tuning parameter that balances spatial distance and expression-based similarity.
- The values in the table indicate which **light chain ID** each heavy chain is paired with under that omega setting.

**Why this structure?**
- In most datasets, there are **fewer heavy chains** than light chains. Therefore, we treat heavy chains as the row index.
- Researchers can inspect how pairings change with different Ï‰ values and select a pairing strategy based on spatial vs. expression-based priorities.

You can run the pairing code (see `/scripts`) to generate this output automatically from your point patterns and REPAIR mapping matrix.
